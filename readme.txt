== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.1.4 =
This updated fixes an error with the format of the date in notification emails. Now it will show you the date formatted however you have chosen for it to be formatted in your WordPress installation. It also now displays the correct start of the week depending on the language selected for the datepicker. A .pot file is now included for easier translations.

= 1.1.3 =
This update fixes an error when the form had validation errors (missing fields or wrong date/time selected). Instead of loading the selected date it would load today's date. This update ensures the selected date is reloaded properly.

= 1.1.2 =
This update fixes an error some people may experience when trying to save settings. This is the second update today, so if you missed the other one please read the changelog for the 1.1.1 update as well.

= 1.1.1 =
This update fixes problems some users reported when using the Firefox browser to modify the booking schedule. This required an update to a library that is shared with another plugin, Food and Drink Menu. If you are using that plugin, please update that one as well or you may get some odd behavior. (Thanks to sangwh and bforsoft for reporting the issue.)

= 1.1 =
This update improves internationalization (i8n) by attempting to determine the appropriate language for the booking form datepicker from your WordPress settings. It also adds a setting to pick a language manually from a list of supported languages. This update also adds options to block late bookings at least 4 hours or 1 day in advance. Thanks to Remco and Roland for their early feedback.

= 1.0.2 =
This update removes a bit of code that was used for development purposes. Please update as this code could be run by any user on the frontend.
